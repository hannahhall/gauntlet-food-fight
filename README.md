#Food Fight

Group project for NSS Cohort 13:
Hannah Hall, Megan Ford, and Keith Bradley
Requirements:
1. Create a game using prototypal inheritance
1. Once the player has chosen all options for class, weapon, etc., you need to have a battlefield view that fulfills the following criteria.
1. Display the initial statistics for the player and the enemy.
2. Have a button with the label "Attack".
3. Each time the attack button is clicked, the player's chosen character and the generated enemy should attack with their weapon, and once the damage is calculated, subtract that from the opponents' health.
4. As soon as either combatant reaches health of 0, disable the attack button and annouce the winner.
